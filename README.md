# Iron Kaggle
Predict future sales using a supervised learning regression model.

## Project Results
In this project, we processed an input dataset of sales history, then explored different ML models to predict future sales results: LinearRegression, RandomForestRegressor (best one) and XBoost. Finally, we did some hyperparameter tuning to push the model's r2 score to **0.941**.  

Final r2 score using the real labels:  **0.916**.

## Project Presentation

LETS COMPETE! Before you jump further, we want you to have an end-to-end experience of solving
a Machine Learning problem.

So let’s try and predict the sales of shops, shall we?

You have a dataset containing information on shops’ sales per day (and several characteristics of
them) - your goal is to predict the sales!

Training data (640841 entries): we will share with you a training set of store sales per day, with bits of
information of what happened in that day in that store.

Real-Life Data (+70k entries): we will also share with you entries without the sales. This will be used (on the
teachers side) to verify how good your model really is!

## Expected Delivery
+ “Real-life data set” with an extra column called “sales”, with your predictions (in .csv)
+ An expected value of R2 of performance of your model
+ A 5’ presentation on the choices you did and the road you took

## Schedule
+ 8am: Introduction, Group organization, framing the problem
+ 8.30am: Development time
+ 1pm: Lunch break
+ 2pm: You will receive the “real-life” data
+ 2pm: Development time + presentation creation
+ 4.30pm: Delivery of the real life data
+ 430pm-5pm: Finish your presentation
+ 5pm: presentations + winner announcement

## Deliverable
+ A .csv file called with your groupd name (e.g, ‘G1.csv’, ‘G2.csv’)
+ The value of R2 you are expecting to get
+ Send this in a .zip file containing two elements:
+ the csv file
+ a txt file with the R2 score inside

## Winners
+ Winner 1 -> Group with the highest R2 score
+ Winner 2 -> Group with the most correct prediction of their own R2 score

BOTH CAN BE THE SAME GROUP
